Dataset 1 (FFT for feature Extraction)
Import the training and test data from the below link
		https://www.kaggle.com/c/predict-volcanic-eruptions-ingv-oe/data
Step1: Give the path for train.csv , sample_submission.csv in the Dataset1_Pickle.ipynb
Step2: Upon running this files the following pickle files will be created
			X_train_T1.pickle
			y_train_T1.pickle
			X_test_T1.pickle
Step3: Now you can try running the models on Dataset 1 by importing the pickle files
